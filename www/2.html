      <div style="text-indent: 0em">
        <p>
          <em>In our first blog, we explored the idea of social
          sovereignty&mdash;the right of individuals to be in control of their
          digital experiences. Here, we turn to social epistemology: how
          communities discover and agree on truth.</em>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Social Epistemology is the study of how people gain, share, and assess
      knowledge through social processes &mdash; not just as lone thinkers,
      but as members of groups, institutions and networks. This study is
      concerned both with descriptive questions, such as how information flows
      and aggregates, and normative questions, such as how we ought to
      structure processes, norms and institutions to maximize the value and
      truthfulness of the resulting knowledge. It rests at the intersection of
      Philosophy, Mathematics, Computer Science and Psychology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many social epistemic concepts have already made their way into the
      public discourse: echo chambers or (epistemic) bubbles, misinformation,
      disinformation, propaganda, prediction markets, wisdom of the crowds,
      the replication crisis in Science, P-hacking, peer review, common
      knowledge, reputation, web of trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, there are a number of human institutions centered around
      knowledge acquisition and information elicitation: courts should assess
      the veracity of accusations, surveys and elections elicit majority
      opinion and conferences and peer-reviewed journals increase the quality
      of academic publications.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there is an incidental evolved institution which also serves
      the purpose of information elicitation and aggregation: markets. Indeed,
      market prices are a culmination of two important pieces of information:
      supply and demand. They help entrepreneurs judge which enterprises are
      the most important, and they communicate to consumers what they can
      expend and what they should ration. Additionally, market prices
      incorporate information, as any individual or organization that believes
      in a significantly different future price for an asset can profitably
      buy or sell it. This concept has been taken to the extreme, first with
      betting houses and derivatives trading, and more recently with
      prediction markets.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-2">Social media and knowledge problems<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      In the realm of social media, there are a number of social epistemic
      problems. Content moderation needs knowledge of whether a piece of
      content violates a content policy or community guidelines. Fact-checking
      needs knowledge of the propositions being fact-checked themselves
      <div class="footnote">
        <font style="font-size: 77.1%"><div align="justify">
          <div style="margin-left: 0px">
            <div style="margin-right: 0px">
              <class style="font-style: normal"><p>
                1. As a matter of fact, it is possible to see fact-checking as
                a special case of content moderation, where the content policy
                allows exactly content which is true. However, we find it
                helpful to make the distinction that fact-checking is usually
                much more expensive labor-wise than moderation.
              </p></class>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div></font>
      </div>

      <a id="footnr-1"></a>
      <sup><class style="font-style: normal"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></class></sup>
      . Even recommendation systems need knowledge of the suitability of
      content for display to a user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite recent large strides in moderation with the help of Machine
      Learning models, by and large this knowledge is not tractable to
      machines, and is instead extracted from human interactions. Indeed, in
      modern social media, moderators vote to moderate content or not,
      fact-checkers are employed to judge the veracity of posts and user
      features derived from their actions become inputs to recommendation
      systems. The question is then how good these systems are.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we mentioned in our previous blog post, a critical mass of users is
      dissatisfied with content moderation and fact-checking in modern social
      media. They believe themselves or other content creators are unfairly
      censored, while others are permitted to keep policy-violating content.
      Some believe the platforms cater to outside government pressures (such
      as documented in the Twitter Files) and some believe many moderators are
      zealots who disregard content policy and instead judge content by
      ideological alignment. And why would it be any different? In other
      words, what incentives do oligopolistic platforms have to fight
      governments to protect users, and what incentives do moderators have to
      adhere to the content policy when they are underpaid and unaudited?
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly, social media is in dire need of better social epistemic
      processes for moderation and fact-checking. The beginning of our blog
      series will explore many such processes, called <em>mechanisms</em>, and
      seek to understand their suitability for social media. Our first object
      of study is the Birdwatch model, which underpins Community Notes.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-3">Birdwatch<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      In the Birdwatch model [<a href="#bib-Birdwatch">3</a>], each user \(u\) and each note
      \(n\) have two parameters. The first parameter, denoted \(f_u\) and
      \(f_n\), is called <em>polarity</em>, and is meant to represent the
      position of the user or note in an ideological spectrum. In the version
      of Birdwatch used in Community Notes, these polarities are real numbers.
      However, Birdwatch is a model inspired by Matrix Factorization, and can
      easily admit the placement of users and notes in a multidimensional
      spectrum, in which case \(f_u\) and \(f_n\) are vectors, called feature
      vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second parameter is called intercept, and its meaning is different
      for users and notes. The intercept \(i_u\) of a user models how
      &ldquo;easy-going&rdquo; or charitable the user is when rating, while
      the intercept \(i_n\) of a note models the intrinsic quality of the
      note. There are more technicalities in the model, such as the
      &ldquo;global-mood&rdquo; parameter \(\mu\) and hyper-parameters
      penalizing unrealistic polarities and intercepts, but we will overlook
      those in this exposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Birdwatch model, like a Matrix Factorization model, tries to fit its
      parameters to explain the rating matrix. Its loss function has terms of
      the form
    </p>
    <center>
      \(\displaystyle (\mu + i_u + i_n + f_u \cdot f_n - r_{u n})^2\)
    </center>
    <p>
      for each rating \(r_{u n} \in [0, 1]\) a user \(u\) has given to a note
      \(n\) (\(r_{u n} = 0\) means &ldquo;unhelpful&rdquo; and \(r_{u n} = 1\)
      means &ldquo;helpful&rdquo;). The formula is merely stating that a
      helpful rating is positively correlated with higher rater charity,
      higher note intrinsic quality, and higher ideological alignment between
      the rater and the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birdwatch traditionally optimizes the parameters with SGD, although the
      Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm can also be used. Once this
      optimization is done, the note intercepts, which are meant as their
      intrinsic qualities, can be used to decide whether to display the note
      or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Community Notes, there are actually a number of heuristics applied to
      filter and process the inputs to Birdwatch, which is run twice. These
      are not of core importance to us.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-4">The shortcomings of Birdwatch<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      Before we consider attacks against Birdwatch, it is worth noting that,
      even if it works as intended, it is not the ideal mechanism for content
      moderation and fact-checking. We do see it as a measurable step up from
      the opaque moderation social media has been haunted with, and we see its
      undeniable success as a testament to how desperately social media users
      demand better mechanisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birdwatch is an instance of what is known as a bridging algorithm,
      meaning that it will try to push content that is agreeable across a wide
      variety of ideological positions. The idea is that, if many people
      across the ideological spectrum agree that a note is helpful, then it
      must really be helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it is also true that an end of the ideological spectrum can
      unilaterally embargo notes. While there may not be many false positives
      with Community Notes, there is a large amount of false negatives [<a
      href="#bib-Supernotes">1</a>]. In practice, only mild and docile truths are able to
      &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; the ideological spectrum. However, the most
      important truths are often the most contended ones, and these are bound
      not to surface via the Birdwatch model.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-5">Attacking Birdwatch<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      The Birdwatch model is quite vulnerable, with only a small coalition
      necessary to override the labeling of notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a simple Sybil attack, the coalition &ldquo;farms&rdquo; identities
      by copying the ratings of the most radical users, i.e., the users
      farthest to the ends of the ideological spectrum. It can build a small
      militia of digital identities, about half of which are radically opposed
      to the others. Whenever the coalition would like to override the
      labeling of a note, it can simply have enough of these opposing
      identities agree with the desired label. The model will tilt the note's
      intercept in response to this unlikely agreement across the spectrum.
      The identities that mislabeled in the attack will become a bit less
      radicalized, expending a small amount of resources used to farm
      identities from the coalition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Countering Sybil attacks is one of the main reasons that Twitter/X has a
      vetting process for participants of Community Notes, as well as its set
      of heuristics on top of the Birdwatch model. However, this approach
      sacrifices decentralization, as a central authority selects which people
      can participate.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-6">Improving Birdwatch<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      We explored using blockchain passports as a vetting mechanism, and even
      created a protocol to boost the pseudonymity of raters among passport
      holders
      <div class="footnote">
        <font style="font-size: 77.1%"><div align="justify">
          <div style="margin-left: 0px">
            <div style="margin-right: 0px">
              <class style="font-style: normal"><p>
                2. Pseudonymity is required because ratings are sensitive
                (often political or ideological) information, which could lead
                to persecution.
              </p></class>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div></font>
      </div>
      <span style="margin-left: 0em"></span>
      <a id="footnr-2"></a>
      <sup><class style="font-style: normal"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></class></sup>
      . It can serve as a general pseudonymity solution to any mechanism but,
      of course, it is only a mitigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also attempted variations of the Birdwatch model. We considered
      weighting users by a super-linear function of their stake, akin to
      Proof-of-Stake, to mitigate Sybil attacks. We also considered limiting
      the freedom of users in choosing which notes they rate, by assigning
      notes to raters. We found that, even with these modifications,
      coordinated attacks of a small coalition can still significantly change
      the labeling of notes (not to mention that the second modification hurts
      usability).
    </p>
    <p>
      Weaknesses in the Birdwatch model have also been noted by others. In [<a
      href="#bib-HawkEye">2</a>], the HawkEye model is proposed as an improvement to
      Birdwatch. It is more resilient, but a similar strategy of identity
      farming and coordinated mislabeling is still able to change its note
      credibility scores, albeit requiring more effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      These kinds of adversarial attacks against models are, in general, quite
      difficult to work around. They are especially pernicious in averaging
      models. For instance, in HawkEye, a user's rating trustworthiness is
      effectively their empirical accuracy over rated items. For a user with
      many ratings, a single mis-rating is not severely punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another sub-theme in adversarial attacks is that honest user behavior
      is, by definition, not coordinated. The influences of honest users in
      the model often cancel each other due to the natural divergences and
      disagreements between them, while coalitions can be extremely precise in
      optimizing their interactions to maximize their influence.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-7">Alternative mechanisms<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      In future blog posts, we will discuss other kinds of mechanisms in
      Social Epistemology. Unlike Birdwatch, we will be interested in
      mechanisms with truth-telling incentives, where users input what they
      truly believe not by principle, but due to financial rewards and
      penalties. Ideally, users that consistently deceive will be punished,
      while truth-tellers are rewarded. Furthermore, the mechanisms must be
      capable of correctly forming knowledge about the truth of even the most
      inconvenient of propositions.
