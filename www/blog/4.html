    <p>
      In the previous blog post, we studied moderation mechanisms that rely on
      oracles, and decided to move on to more decentralized ones. In
      this and in the following posts, we will share a bit of our research
      story, going over many of the mechanisms we considered for Information
      Elicitation Without Verification (IEWV). Our entry point to this area of
      research was a mechanism trying to address the problem of untruthful
      replies in surveys.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some surveys, this problem is not pronounced. For instance, in
      political surveys, a good result for a candidate tends to benefit that
      candidate, so people already have the incentive to answer truthfully,
      i.e., to name the candidate they intend to vote on. Deceit in political
      surveys comes primarily from corruption of the survey organization or
      from exogenous incentives, such as bribes or threats, not from the
      mechanism's incentives.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, other kinds of surveys carry incentives that distort the
      quality of the survey. For example, in a political survey for who is the
      best candidate, people have the incentive to name the candidate they
      would like to win and will vote for instead (because his policies
      benefit the person the most), rather than the candidate they consider
      the best for the country overall. Again this is because a positive poll
      result tends to improve the chances of a candidate winning. People also
      tend to lie when the survey question regards intimate matters or when
      their answer could be self-incriminating. Furthermore, as of right now,
      we are experiencing times of significant political violence. Thus, in an
      opinion survey on a polarizing topic, people might refrain from
      expressing an opinion that may cause retaliation, if the privacy of the
      poll were to be compromised.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-1">The Bayesian Truth Serum<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      In 2004, Drazen Prelec [<a href="#bib-DrazenPrelec">9</a>] published the Bayesian Truth
      Serum [<a href="#bib-BayesianTruthSerum">4</a>], or BTS, an extremely clever mechanism to improve
      survey quality. The idea is that each participant reports not only his
      belief, called his <em>signal</em>, but also his estimate on which
      fraction of the other participants will report the same signal. The BTS
      is a formula to assign to each survey participant, or <em>player</em>, a
      score, which is meant to be monotonically converted into a monetary
      payout. Players then have a financial incentive to maximize this score,
      which is designed to create truth-telling incentives.
    </p>
    <p>
      More precisely, suppose that we have \(n\) players (\(n\) very large)
      and \(m\) possible choices (\(m\) small). Each player \(i\) reports a
      signal, seen as an indicator vector \(x_i \in \{ 0, 1 \}^m\), exactly
      one component of which is \(1\), the others being \(0\). Furthermore,
      each player \(i\) reports an estimated frequency vector \(y_i \in [0,
      1]^m\) whose components sum to \(1\), where \(y_{i j}\) is his
      estimation of the frequency of answer \(j\), i.e., of
    </p>
    <center>
      \begin{eqnarray*}
  \bar{x}_j & = & \frac{1}{n}  \sum_i x_{i j}
      .
\end{eqnarray*}
    </center>
    <p>
      Let \(\bar{y}_j\) be the geometric mean of the estimated frequencies for
      answer \(j\), i.e.,
    </p>
    <center>
      \begin{eqnarray*}
  \bar{y}_j & = & \sqrt[n]{\prod_i y_{i j}}
      .
\end{eqnarray*}
    </center>
    <p>
      Then a simplified formula for the BTS score of player \(i\) is
    </p>
    <center>
      \(\displaystyle \underbrace{\sum_j x_{i j}
      \log
\frac{\bar{x}_j}{\bar{y}_j}}_{\text{information score}} +
      \alpha
\underbrace{\sum_j \bar{x}_j \log \frac{y_{i
      j}}{\bar{x}_j}}_{\text{prediction score}},\)
    </center>
    <p>
      where the constant \(\alpha > 0\) and the base of the logarithms are
      tuning constants not consequential in this exposition, although we will
      mention that setting \(\alpha = 1\) makes the scores zero-sum. The
      formula is made of two terms, an information score and a prediction
      score. Because \(n\) is large, an individual player cannot hope to
      affect either \(\bar{x}_j\) or \(\bar{y}_j\) directly, so, from his
      point of view, his information score depends only on his answer \(x_i\),
      while his prediction score only on his estimated frequencies \(y_i\).
      Therefore, rational players seek to maximize both scores independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prediction score simplifies to
    </p>
    <center>
      \(\displaystyle \underbrace{\sum_j \bar{x}_j \log y_{i
      j}}_{\text{logarithmic scoring rule}} +
\underbrace{\sum_j -\bar{x}_j
      \log \bar{x}_j .}_{\text{entropy of $\bar{x}$}}\)
    </center>
    <p>
      Since the entropy of the frequency vector is not under the control of
      player \(i\), he can only hope to maximize the remaining term, which is
      a strictly proper scoring rule [<a href="#bib-ScoringRule">10</a>], and thus is maximized
      by \(y_{i j} = \bar{x}_j\), creating truth-telling incentives for the
      reporting of estimated frequencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something more interesting happens with the information score. Since
      \(x_i\) is an indicator vector, player \(i\) should aim to choose the
      largest value of \(\log (\bar{x}_j / \bar{y}_j)\) over all answers
      \(j\). This logarithm measures how &ldquo;surprisingly common&rdquo; the
      answer is, in that its actual frequency is higher than expected. The
      brilliance of the BTS is the observation that the signal a player
      receives influences his estimation of the frequency of the signal,
      because the player already observed a sample of size one, so to speak.
      Thus, in a truth-telling Bayesian Nash equilibrium, where players report
      their answers and estimates truthfully, players that received the same
      signal will report similarly to player \(i\), while players that receive
      a different signal will tend to under-estimate the frequency of the
      signal. This is mere intuition, however. The proof of a truth-telling
      Bayesian Nash equilibrium has some assumptions and is presented in
      Prelec's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, instead of frequencies, the surveyor, also called the
      <em>principal</em>, wishes for one definitive answer, for instance to
      make a decision, he can simply pick a choice \(j\) maximizing the
      Surprisingly Popular (SP) score [<a href="#bib-BayesianTruthSerumSuprisinglyPopularScore">5</a>] given by
    </p>
    <center>
      \(\displaystyle \bar{x}_j - \frac{1}{n}  \sum_i y_{i j} .\)
    </center>
    <p>
      The careful reader may have noticed that a player can bring the
      geometric mean \(\bar{y}_j\) to zero simply by estimating a frequency of
      zero. Indeed, the exposition of the BTS conducted here is simplified. In
      practice, BTS scores use Laplacian smoothing to avoid degeneration of
      the geometric mean, as well as a few other tricks, such as &ldquo;leave
      one out&rdquo; aggregates \(\bar{x}_{- i j}\) and \(\bar{y}_{- i j}\) to
      ensure players do not directly alter these values at all.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-2">Applications<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      The BTS has been extensively used to improve the quality of surveys
      suffering from truth-telling disincentives. Prelec himself and others
      have applied the method to surveys on academic integrity [<a href="#bib-BayesianTruthSerumQuestionableResearchPractices">2</a>]
      and marketing [<a href="#bib-BayesianTruthSerumTruthTellingIncentives">8</a>], but the mechanism has also been applied
      to Criminology [<a href="#bib-BayesianTruthSerumCriminology">7</a>], information crowd-sourcing via Amazon's
      Mechanical Turk [<a href="#bib-BayesianTruthSerumMechanicalTurk">1</a>], energy price forecasting [<a href="#bib-BayesianTruthSerumEnergyPriceForecasting">11</a>]
      and even to Machine Learning [<a href="#bib-MachineTruthSerum">3</a>].
    </p>
    <p>
      Although not directly applying the Bayesian Truth Serum, Th&eacute;o,
      the French whale who won a huge bet on Donald Trump's election on
      Polymarket [<a href="#bib-FrenchTrumpPolymarketWhale">6</a>], also relied on surveys of second-order
      beliefs, asking participants not who they thought would win, but who
      they thought their neighbors would vote for. Th&eacute;o stated that his
      surveys countered the &ldquo;shy Trump voter&rdquo; effect, as an answer
      about a collective reveals less personal beliefs than a direct answer,
      enabling people to speak with less fear of retaliation.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-3">Shortcomings of the BTS<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      The BTS mechanism has a number of disadvantages that prevent its usage
      in content moderation. First of all, being designed for usage in
      surveys, the BTS is not collusion-resistant (it is generally accepted
      that survey participants do not collude). Our analysis assumed that
      individual players cannot alter the observed frequencies \(\bar{x}_j\)
      and their estimations \(\bar{y}_j\). However, a large coalition not only
      can alter these aggregates, but benefit from doing so. The attack
      consists of the whole of the coalition reporting a very unlikely signal
      and estimating frequencies truthfully (including their knowledge of the
      existence of the coalition). Their signal will be extremely
      &ldquo;surprisingly common,&rdquo; with a very high information score.
      Furthermore, the knowledge of the coalition and its strategy will make
      their frequency estimations more accurate than those of honest players.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear that mechanisms that require the estimation of frequencies
      are hard to make collusion resistant. Besides the user experience
      becoming more cumbersome with this extra report, this is the main reason
      we will focus our attention on <em>minimal</em> mechanisms, where
      players only report their observed signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BTS also has an assumption of common knowledge of common priors
      between players, which is very hard to argue for in a diverse crowd,
      such as in social media. Thus we will also look for mechanisms that are
      <em>detail-free</em>, i.e., which do not place significant assumptions
      on the prior knowledge of players.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another problem of the mechanism is the large population of respondents,
      which, in the simple form we presented, needs to be essentially infinite
      for the Bayesian Nash equilibrium result to hold. This is another
      trade-off that applies well to surveys, which interview a large
      population. In contrast, moderation decisions are made by only a few
      moderators, so we need mechanisms that work on a <em>small
      population</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the BTS is a very <em>complex</em> mechanism, with even the
      simplified version in this blog post already being quite difficult to
      grasp. Explaining the mechanism to a large population of users is close
      to impossible. Stating instead that truth-telling maximizes the expected
      payout is more akin to intimidation than to proper truth-telling
      incentives. Only if the BTS became popular and mainstream, with
      independent experts agreeing on the properties of the mechanism and
      propagating that trust to the public, would the BTS really have
      truth-telling incentives.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-4">Conclusion<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      The BTS is a mechanism to create truth-telling incentives in surveys in
      exchange for financial compensation of the participants. It is
      particularly important in surveys where honest reporting is contrary to
      already existing incentives, such as fear of retaliation or
      self-incrimination. However, there are a number of issues with the
      direct application of the BTS to the problem of decentralized
      moderation, particularly its lack of collusion resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our next blog post, we will continue to explore IEWV mechanisms, and
      will focus on peer-prediction, covering mechanisms designed for smaller
      populations, including some improvements on the BTS.
