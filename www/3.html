      Recall that we seek social epistemic mechanisms that are decentralized,
      permissionless, secure and which carry truth-telling incentives. In our
      previous blog post, we explored Community Notes' Birdwatch model, and
      concluded that it cannot be simultaneously permissionless and secure,
      and that it does not have truth-telling incentives. We point out again
      that Community Notes has been a massive success, impacting social
      discourse in a positive and constructive way, even if its underlying
      model was not theoretically sound. This motivates us to continue our
      search for better mechanisms, even though finding one that
      simultaneously satisfies all of our desiderata is an extremely
      challenging, if not impossible, task.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this blog post, we discuss a few mechanisms, among them one that
      recently gained enormous momentum: prediction markets.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-1">Prediction Markets<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      What distinguishes prediction markets and betting houses is that the
      former is specifically designed for information elicitation. The price
      of a security in a prediction market is aggregated knowledge of the
      probability of a future event. Anyone who has strong beliefs in either
      direction away from the current security price can, according to their
      beliefs, make a profitable purchase of either the security itself or of
      its complementary securities. Conversely, at any particular point in
      time, no one is willing to bet against the knowledge encoded in the
      current security price.
    </p>
    <a id="footnr-1"></a>
    <p>
      While it may be true that trading fees can reduce the accuracy of the
      encoded probability and that users have different risk profiles and
      differently sized pools of capital, prediction markets are still the
      gold-standard of social epistemic mechanisms in terms of security.
      Truth-telling, i.e., betting on what one believes, is a dominant
      strategy<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and forming coalitions is not profitable.

                myopically incentive-compatible.

      Prediction markets have a long history. Several early prediction markets
      were used to predict the outcome of elections [<a href="#bib-IowaElectronicMarkets">14</a>], movie
      box-office profits [<a href="#bib-HollywoodStockExchange">12</a>] and even the time for the delivery
      of a construction project [<a href="#bib-TheGatesHilllmanPredictionMarket">18</a>]. Truthcoin [<a href="#bib-Truthcoin">21</a>]
      is, to our knowledge, the first design of a prediction market on a
      blockchain, and one of its goals was finding correlations between policy
      decisions and their outcomes [<a href="#bib-TruthcoinWhitepaper">22</a>]. Using prediction markets
      to govern decisions is called Futarchy [<a href="#bib-Futarchy">10</a>], a proposition
      by famous economist Robin Hanson [<a href="#bib-RobinHanson">11</a>], who is known as the
      father of prediction markets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, prediction markets have a wide range of untapped
      application potential: mainstream prediction markets, such as Polymarket
      [<a href="#bib-Polymarket">19</a>] and Kalshi [<a href="#bib-Kalshi">15</a>], deal only with
      <em>simple securities</em>, usually with only a few, one for each
      outcome. However, more advanced prediction markets support much larger
      outcome spaces and <em>complex securities</em> that describe sets of
      these outcomes. For instance, in permutation or ranking markets, there
      are \(n!\) outcomes for \(n\) players, but users could bet on \(n (n -
      1)\) securities of the form &ldquo;player \(i\) finishes ahead of player
      \(j\)&rdquo; [<a href="#bib-OptimizationBasedFrameworkAutomatedMarketMaking2010">1</a>] or \(n^2\) ones of the form &ldquo;player
      \(i\) finishes in position \(j\)&rdquo; [<a href="#bib-BettingOnPermutations">5</a>][<a href="#bib-ParimutuelBettingPermutations">3</a>].
      Other possibilities include tournament markets [<a href="#bib-TournamentPredictionMarkets">6</a>],
      hierarchical markets [<a href="#bib-EventHierarchyPredictionMarket">8</a>] and continuous and geometric
      markets [<a href="#bib-OptimizationBasedFrameworkAutomatedMarketMaking2011">2</a>][<a href="#bib-GeometricPredictionMarket">17</a>][<a href="#bib-MarketMakersForCombinatorialSecurities">13</a>]. Application
      possibilities are numerous, from more efficient sports betting to
      earthquake or hurricane insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the Achilles heel of prediction markets is that they are
      not decentralized. In order to settle trades at the end of a market, the
      mechanism relies on an <em>oracle</em>. There have been occasions in
      which high-stakes prediction markets were resolved against their
      final-price consensus by their oracles [<a href="#bib-RektNews-HedgingBets">20</a>]. As a
      consequence, self-resolving prediction markets have been proposed, and
      we shall consider at least one of them in a future blog post.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-2">Omniscience<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      Simply because prediction markets are centralized, it does not mean that
      they are not useful for moderation in decentralized social media.
      Vitalik Buterin has considered the use of prediction markets as an
      extension of a central moderator's capabilities [<a href="#bib-VitalikModerationFutarchy">4</a>].
      Essentially, every social media item would get its own individual
      market, that predicts whether this central moderator, called Doug, will
      decide to moderate the item or not, when, and if, he looks at the item.
      Vitalik's insight is that, even if Doug only actually looks at a small
      fraction of the items, the incentive for traders is to trade honestly in
      <em>all</em> the markets, and their security prices can be used for
      moderation decisions. Trades in markets whose items Doug does not
      inspect are reversed, and the only markets where trades are settled are
      the ones manually resolved by Doug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, there is a significant amount of details that have to be
      filled in, such as how to reverse trades and how to mitigate the
      opportunity cost of capital lingering in these markets. One detail that
      we address is how to bootstrap liquidity in these markets, as, even with
      fees, market creators may have impermanent loss of their initial
      liquidity. We propose to only start prediction markets on flagged items,
      because the item author and the moderator are two necessarily
      disagreeing parties and, each under their own beliefs, are expected to
      turn a profit. This does require authors to place some collateral on
      each item, but that can be returned to them if the post ages enough
      without flags, if the market is reversed or if they win Doug's favor in
      an arbitration.
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea is quite useful because it solves the <em>alignment
      problem</em> between individual moderators and moderation companies (or
      individuals, such as Doug) offering moderation services. Presently,
      moderators have very little incentive to stay honest. If and when one of
      their decisions gets audited, they can claim an honest mistake or simply
      leave the system, because they do not have much collateral staked. It is
      thus hard to have a healthy market of moderation services when these
      services hire from a common pool of moderators. In contrast, applying
      prediction markets affords Doug an &ldquo;epistemic extension,&rdquo;
      which we call <em>omniscience</em>, and, the more trusted Doug is, the
      larger and sharper this extension can become. Paradoxically, centralized
      prediction markets can help decentralize moderation by the
      straightforward introduction of competition, with many people taking the
      role of Doug and with many competing moderation policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two other methods to achieve the omniscience effect, both
      mentioned in a thread [<a href="#bib-DougPoker">7</a>] started by Konstantin Kladko [<a
      href="#bib-kladkogex">16</a>] as a response to Vitalik.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-3">Robin Hanson's Double or Nothing Lawsuits<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      Robin Hanson proposes a simple mechanism [<a href="#bib-DoubleOrNothingLawsuits">9</a>] to
      disincentivize wrong behavior even when the maximum harm caused is
      small, making litigation unattractive. He proposed using a randomizer
      &ldquo;office&rdquo; or machine, in which a legal claim could be doubled
      or destroyed, with 50% chance of each. This way, the value of the claim
      doesn't change in expectation, but small claims could potentially become
      large claims worth legally pursuing, even though only with a tiny
      probability. The brilliance of this scheme is that litigation would only
      occur in a small fraction of claims, with its cost amortized, while the
      expected loss from misbehavior would be closer to the damage
      restitution, rather than to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      One challenge with this idea in social media is that some users have
      close to zero collateral, and they would not be able to pay an amount
      that has been doubled many times. However, maybe moderators can. Doug
      could require his moderators to deposit a significant collateral \(C\)
      (say \(10^6\) sats) for taking part in his moderation company. Those
      moderators would then get the power to take down items on behalf of
      Doug. Item authors that believe they have been wronged by a moderation
      decision can buy a small claim of \(c\) (e.g., \(10^4\) sats) against
      the moderator for a much cheaper price \(p\) (maybe \(500\) sats), and,
      rather than repeatedly doubling it, they can directly increase it to
      \(C\) with probability \(c / C\). Only these large claims would require
      intervention from Doug. If the author has Doug's favor, he receives \(C
      + p\) from the fired moderator's collateral and the initial purchase.
      Otherwise, if Doug is not summoned or favors the moderator, the
      moderator is paid \(p\).
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this scheme, a Bayesian moderator has an incentive to work for
      Doug as long as his decision accuracy is more than \(1 - p / c\), and a
      Bayesian user has an incentive to buy claims when their judgment
      accuracy is at least roughly \(p / c\). Thus, there is considerable
      margin for the choice of the parameters \(c\) and \(p\), accommodating
      other risk profiles.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-4">Moderation Poker<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      One downside of the previous approach is that the damages from the
      removal of a particular item are not accounted for, only the average
      damages. Thus, an ideological moderator still has the incentive to
      censor only the items he opposes that are gaining significant traction,
      since the social cost to him of the success of the item outweighs his
      expected loss in the mechanism. To some extent, this issue can also
      affect the first approach with prediction markets, because the moderator
      could bet on Doug not inspecting the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      To overcome this issue, we need to allow every dispute to potentially
      escalate to Doug. Like in our proposition on how to bootstrap liquidity,
      when an author posts an item, they deposit a small amount of collateral,
      which can be refunded to them later. In order for a moderator to flag
      the item, they have to also commit collateral, which becomes the item's
      pot. Then, starting with the author, each side takes turns at least
      doubling the pot. If a side folds and does not double the pot, the other
      side takes the whole pot and the right over the moderation outcome.
      Otherwise, eventually the pot size will become large enough, say \(P\),
      to merit the intervention of Doug, who resolves the dispute and gives
      the pot and the moderation outcome to the winner.
    </p>
    <p>
      One advantage of this scheme is that third parties besides the author
      and moderator can contribute to the dispute, helping increase the pot.
      At the end, the pot would be split proportionally to contributions to
      the members of the winning side. However, still, in order not to depend
      on others, authors have to keep about \(kP / 2\) capital available in
      order to unconditionally defend \(k\) of their items, and that is also
      the sum that honest moderators have to keep to unconditionally defend
      \(k\) moderation decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides this capital inefficiency, there is also the issue of
      Denial-of-Service, where a whale trying to disrupt the moderation system
      escalates \(n\) disputes, where \(n\) is much larger than Doug's
      throughput in several decades. While eventually the whale might lose up
      to about \(nP / 2\) in capital, the moderation will stop and users will
      have their capital locked in for unreasonable amounts of time.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-5">Conclusion<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      We have explored oracle-dependent mechanisms to epistemically extend
      centralized moderation in order to enable a free-market of moderation
      services. We found that, even under the big assumption of a trusted
      oracle, incentive issues still remain, particularly around the
      <em>exogenous value</em> of moderation decisions, which are hard for
      mechanisms to account for. While the mechanisms described are expected
      to work effectively and efficiently for most items, making sure that
      they work for items of high exogenous value is still elusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, the assumption of a trusted oracle is rather brittle, since
      power corrupts, and there are always lingering threats of bribery,
      blackmail, exit scams and ideological co-optation. In some sense, the
      success of systems based on centralized oracles can be their downfall,
      as the more capital it manages, the bigger the target they are and the
      bigger the risk of these threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing this concern, in our next blog post, we will delve into the
      area of Information Elicitation Without Verification (IEWV), which
      considers epistemic mechanisms that do not necessitate oracles, and yet
      still maintain truth-telling incentives.
